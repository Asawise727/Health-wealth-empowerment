    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, our goal is to instill healthy physical and financial habits within communities. We operate ventures that reinvest a minimum of 30%—and up to 50%—of their profits into community initiatives, fostering sustainable growth and development.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>With support from donors and social investors, we launch community-focused businesses. These ventures generate income that directly funds programs such as youth mentorship, financial literacy classes, and local wellness centers, creating a self-sustaining cycle of community empowerment.</p>
